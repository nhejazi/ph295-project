## Summary

We present a generalization of the moderated t-statistic to the case of
asymptotically linear parameters, and investigate the use of this statistic in
estimating group differences in the _average treatment effect_ (ATE), defined in
the form of a statistically identifiable causal target parameter examining the
counterfactual difference in gene expression between receiving the maximum level
of treatment and the minimum level of treatment, for a given gene. The specified
ATE is estimated via Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (TMLE), and the
moderated t-statistic is used to test differences in the influence curve-based
realizations of the ATE between exposure groups.
